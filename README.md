Flutter Weather App

This is a basic weather app built using Flutter that provides users with real-time weather information for their current location or any specified city.

Features:

Location-based weather: Retrieves weather data for the user's current location using Geolocator.
OpenWeatherMap integration: Fetches weather data from the reliable OpenWeatherMap API (you'll need to obtain your own API key).
User-friendly UI: Presents weather information in a clear and visually appealing manner using Cupertino icons.
Internationalization (optional): Supports basic formatting and display of temperature, dates, and times based on the user's locale (requires the intl package).
Dependencies:

cupertino_icons: ^1.0.6 (Provides Cupertino design icons for a native iOS look and feel)
http: ^1.2.1 (Used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API)
intl: ^0.19.0 (Optional, for internationalization)
geolocator: ^12.0.0 (Enables location services for user geolocation)
geocoding: ^3.0.0 (Converts user coordinates into readable addresses)
flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.13.1 (Optional, for creating app icons for different platforms)
